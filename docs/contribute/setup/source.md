## Hamlet Source Code

// output of "tree" showing directories only for all primary repos
```


## Scripted Install
### PreRequisites
* install `jq`  (link)


* the following install will clone
```sh
// add custom version of the install of the repos from the docker repo - just need to have them install to $(pwd) instead of /opt
```


## Other Hamlet Repos
* The following repositories are not a part of the core Hamlet product and can be cloned locally anywhere
	* cli
	* docker
