<Admonition type="warning" title="Under Construction">
The hamlet.io documentation is currently under significant re-development. Existing content is a placeholder and will be updated very soon.
</Admonition>

* Hamlet is designed to keep the user up-to-date with itself as much as possible
* Legacy files support older features and patterns that are used by deployed solutions but have been superseded by a newer approach
* Legacy features will be removed as the known solutions that require them are upgraded to later hamlet versions
	* They should not be used for further hamlet development
