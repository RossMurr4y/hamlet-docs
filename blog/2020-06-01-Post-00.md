Welcome to the start of a new series of blog posts centred around the Hamlet Azure provider. Each article will showcase a different hamlet component type and how it has been implemented by the Azure provider plugin. Along the way we'll draw your attention to some of the unique challenges that hamlet addresses as well as deep dive into some of its features. 

These articles are intended for any infrastructure-as-code experience level. The intent is to build on the topics covered in previous articles, exploring more advanced topics as we progress.

## Component Breakdown - s3 - Azure Provider

Today we're going to get started with one of the basics of the cloud infrastructure world - the cloud storage component `s3`.

`s3` is a standalone object storage component which can be used by other components to store data. A typical hamlet deployment will include a `baseline` component which itself involves some standard storage resources, however the standalone `s3` component is for more advanced or shared configuration options where you might not want to keep this data alongside that which is stored in your `baseline` storage resources. Perhaps you need different permissions, or a more long-term storage option for archival purposes for example.

In Azure, the `s3` component is made up of a single `Storage Account` resource, a `Blob Service` resource assigned to it, and a `Container` inside that Service. This is the bare-minimum required for blob file storage within a `Storage Account`. The final resource is a `KeyVault Secret`, which will be used to store the value of the Storage Account Key - we'll cover KeyVault and this secret a little later on.

Before we dive too far in to templates, lets cover off a few basics.

## Template File

```json
// template.json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "parameters": {  },
  "variables": {  },
  "resources": [  ],
  "outputs": {  }
}
```

This is the barebones of a Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template.json file and its the structure that we are not just going to have hamlet reproduce for us, but populate. Broadly, each section is summed as follows:

**$schema**
> This template property tells ARM at deployment time which template schema that the content within will conform to. This will rarely change, but when it does we want hamlet templates to be consistent. The resources defined within will not deploy if their schema version is incompatible with the template structure itself.

**parameters**
> Much like in most programming languages, parameters defined in this section determine what parameters can be passed to the template, if they have a default value, and what the *type* the value must be. Parameter values can assigned directly in the template or more commonly they are defined within a `template.json` file, and a corresponding `parameters.json` file in the same directory is used to pass values into the template. 
>
>Typically in ARM what this allows you to do is to seperate out secure values for a template and then share the template/parameters files someone else. Then in order to use the template they just fill in the parameters with their own values. In hamlet however where the templates are generated and re-generated as needed, we use them a little differently. Parameters will be covered in more detail in another post because for now - we don't need it.

**variables**
>Unlike parameters that can have default values and be passed in from another file, variables must be defined within the template. Where they shine however is that they can be used to perform rudimentary logic to determine their value. Common use-cases might be to join two parameters values together to form a new value. 
>
>In hamlet, we don't use variables very often because hamlet will typically perform the underlying logic. Using that same example, as the template generation engine, hamlet knows what parameter 1 and parameter 2 are, so can join them together and then hard-code parameter3.
>
>Instead, where hamlet will generally use variables is in combination with special ARM functions that only occur at run-time. That's a rather advanced topic though, so we'll cover that off in another post.

## s3 Template File

Lets take a look at an example ARM Template that hamlet will produce for an `s3` component:

This is a fully functioning, stand-alone Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template file. ARM is the infrastructure-as-code templating language used by Microsoft to deploy infrastructure to the Azure cloud.
