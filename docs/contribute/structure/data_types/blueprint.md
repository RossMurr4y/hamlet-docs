* The blueprint input data type is the composite data from all other input data types at engine runtime

# Structure
* the following is an example of the global blueprint variable

```json
// example skeleton structure of the blueprintObject 
```

# vs Build Blueprint
*  Though related, the blueprint input data type is separate to that of the Build Blueprint resource as it is only ever a global variable
* See the Build Blueprint docs for more information (link)

# Testing
* the blueprint model enables the unit testing capabilities of the Hamlet engine
* By “mocking” the blueprint with a known configuration, tests can be defined
	* Link to testing section
